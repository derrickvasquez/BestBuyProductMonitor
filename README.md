# BestBuy Monitor w/ Discord Notifications

This is a python script that monitors for various products on the BestBuy wesbite. This has the potential to be a way to combat other resellers and scalpers, and obtain the item you've been failing to get. 

## Using the Monitor

Download the latest version pf Python

Clone the repo, update the following items to whatever you desire:
    - item(s) webpage url
    - webhook url
    - author

In your terminal, run the following:

    pip3 install -r requirements.txt

Then, navigate to the directory where the script is located, and run the following command in your terminal:

    python monitor.py




## Future Updates

- Add a way to monitor/scan for various items on the BestBuy website simultaneously 

- Add the use of proxies(currently a huge noob, idk how to do this)

- Run this monitor automatically(?)

- Add monitors for other sites

- etc.
